My implementations of VERY BASIC audio processing

I don't have any extremely meaningful projects in mind so for now they will all go under one repo. Special thanks to Andrew Owen for the mini-project suggestions.

wav_reader.c = takes in a .wav file and outputs the same one to same.wav
wav.h = header file for wav headers and data
volume_decrease.c = takes in .wav file, decreases the volume by a percentage into new.wav. I got stuck for a bit on this one because the sample code I looked at used short int, but I needed to use uint8_t.
